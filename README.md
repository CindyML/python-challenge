My originally submitted assignment was marked incomplete.
However my repo is and was public.
And the link provided was copied straight from github.
Please help me further understand why it could not be accessed.
Thank you.



This is a resubmission with the text files right this time. 
Thank you for the second review.
There is one text code in each folder, which is the document for the results of each part of the assignent
The Ptython Source File is "main" in each folder. "main2" should simply be an exact duplicate and ignored.
